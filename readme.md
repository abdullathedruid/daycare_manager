Framework to allow users to create permissionless bots to adventure time
You can register your summoners with `registerDaycare()` and will pay a fee of 0.1 FTM per summoner per day.

You will need to approve the adventure time contract `0x0D4C98901563ca730332e841EDBCB801fe9F2551` in order to allow users to adventure on your behalf

Anybody will be able to adventure on your behalf in a trustless manner, and in doing so, will receive the 0.1 FTM fee.

Advanced coders will be able to generate scripts/bots that can adventure on behalf of users by calling `executeDaycare()`
Hopefully the economic incentives add up.

Feel free to deploy to re-deploy the contract with a different fee if the price of FTM varies significantly.
